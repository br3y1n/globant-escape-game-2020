                This enigma comes from our top agent in Pune, Deepak Kumraw. He has a secret panel in his office, with an 8x8 button pad. In order to open the panel, you must press eight buttons, one in each column, from left to right, without ever clicking two buttons in the same row or diagonal.
            </P>
            <br />
            <P>
                Good luck with this mission!

                To pass Deepak Kumraw's test, you must write an 8 digit octal number, one digit from each column, from left to right, according to the buttons you decided to press. The number must be the highest possible!
